# Tamagotchu

A simple game based on the popular Tamagotchi handheld digital pet. Users can feed, play with, and check on their Tama Friend.

## Background
This application is being built as a self-study project to supplement my classes. I aim to expand my knowledge of Java/OOP, explore new functionality, and expose myself to complimentary technologies such as java build tools (Maven) and version control (git).

## Getting Started

You will need to be comfortable using a command line interface. Navigate to the 'Releases' tab and select the most recent release. Download the appropriate jar file. Run the file with java -jar /path/to/Tamagotchu.jar

## Built With

* [JavaFX 11](https://openjfx.io/) - Client Application Platform
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) - Dependency Management

## Versioning

I use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available, see the [tags on this repository](https://github.com/your/project/tags).
